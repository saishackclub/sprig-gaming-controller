# Sprig gaming controller

*Curious about how this got started? [Check out the original proposal!](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/pull/367)*

## What is this?

I'm building a case for the [Sprig console](https://sprig.hackclub.com) to make it into an actual, portable gaming controller. This is a project for Hack Club's Winter Hardware
Wonderland event.

## What's this repo for?

This repo is for storing everything related to the project. I'll be using it to keep track of my progress, and to share my progress with the Hack Club community.

Additionally, everything in this repo is open source, from the code to the designs. Feel free to use anything you find here in your own projects! However, it would be greatly appreciated if you could credit me, and link back to this repo for others to find.

## What's the plan?

I'm going to be using this repo to keep track of my progress. I'll be updating it with new information as I go along, and I'll be adding new files as I make them. Here's a list of what I'm planning to do:

0. Build a game for Sprig and submit it to the gallery
I'm going to build a game called "Sprig Runner". It's a simple game where you have to avoid obstacles and collect coins. Once I'm done, I'll submit it to the gallery and hopefully it'll get approved.

1. Start on Sprig case design
After I'm done with the game, I'll start on the case design. I'm not sure what I will use to design it, but I'll probably use Fusion 360. I'll also need to figure out how to make the case. I'm thinking of using a 3D printer at my school, but that is very open to change.

2. Build the case and test it (ergonomics, etc.)
After wrapping up the design, I'll start building the case together and test it. I'll make sure it's comfortable to hold and that it's easy to use. Of course, the Sprig console will be inside the case, so I'll have to make sure it fits, which brings me to the next step.

3. Sprig shipped to me
I'm in Singapore, so it's going to take a while. I'll probably get it in a few weeks (hopefully), after which I will test it with the case and make any necessary changes in the design or fitting.

## Budgeting

Everything related to funding this project will be tracked in the [`budget.md`](budget.md) file. I'll be updating it as I go along, and I'll be adding new items as I make them.

## `site/`

This folder contains the source code for the [website](https://gaming.dino.icu) for this project. It's built using [React](https://reactjs.org) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). I'm planning to use it to keep track of my progress, as well as to showcase the final product.

## License

As mentioned above, everything in this repo is open source and all software built for this project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
